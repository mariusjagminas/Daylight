# Daylight

Shows current sunset and sunrise times for a selected location.

## What is your motivation for creating this project?

The changing length of days and nights depends on the location and time of year. It would be nice to know how many hours of daylight we have in a specific location.

## How will users interact with your web site?

The user types in the search box a city or country name, and will get current sunset and sunrise times for that location.

## What 3rd Party API(s) will you integrate with?

- [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
  - To discover the longitude & latitude for the location
  - To get a sunrise & sunset times from long/lat.

## Tech Stack

- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework.

## Will you try to implement any stretch features?

- I'll use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle modules.

## What will be your process?

- I will submit commit when a feature is added, or a task is accomplished.
- I'll test the website manually.
- I will use [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc) to design a layout.
- It will be deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
